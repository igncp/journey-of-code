# Journey of Code

Resolving the Advent of Code challenges from multiple years in multiple
languages. Used for practicing different languages and approaches to the
problems, and also to setup my development environment for each language.

The only dependencies to use this project is using the 'Nix' package manager.
Beware, it will need a lot of storage for the multiple languages. The exercises
should work at least on Linux.

## Rules

The exercises can be resolved with multiple languages, not only using
vanilla features but also with external libraries. Sometimes will try to make
the solution as simple as possible, but other times will over-engineer the
solution to practice more complex features of the language.

Also there may be some common code for all languages with utilities, shared
dependencies, increasing over time. Additionally, there should be linters
adding common formatting and style checks where possible.

All exercises should be runnable with `scripts/run.sh` which should run within
the Nix shell or in the OCI container.

### Languages

Main list. These languages are specially useful for me and I have less
experience with them or want to keep improving with them:

- Kotlin
- Swift
- Lua
- Ruby
- SQL/T-SQL
- Rust

Secondary list. These languages are either interesting but not as useful for me, or I have many experience
with them so I would like to practice them less:

- Bash
- C++/C#/C/Objective-C
- Erlang
- Go
- Haskell
- Java
- PHP
- Python
- TypeScript

To complete a day, it needs to have at least one solution in one of the main
languages list. But of course it can have as many other solutions from
other languages.

These lists may change over time, which will not change the completion status
of already completed days.
